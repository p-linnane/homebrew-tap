# An unofficial tap for software not suitable for the main Homebrew repos

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) requires software to adhere to certain requirements in order to be included in
[`homebrew-core`](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Formulae) or [`homebrew-cask`](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Casks).

As a Homebrew maintainer, I've found various software that is useful but does not meet those requirements.

Since I prefer to install everything using `brew`, I've created this tap to host that sort of software.

## Casks
